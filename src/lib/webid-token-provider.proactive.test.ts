/**
 * PROACTIVE background refresh of the local `WebIdDPoPTokenProvider` port.
 *
 * The lazy paths renew only after a token is already stale (upgrade()-on-expiry,
 * renew-on-rejected-401). Proactive refresh runs the refresh-token grant in the
 * BACKGROUND before expiry so a long import / idle→active session never hits an
 * expired token mid-flow. These tests drive it with vitest fake timers and an
 * injected visibility lifecycle, asserting:
 *   - a refresh fires before expiry with NO upgrade()/401 (grant_type=refresh_token,
 *     getCode never called), and reschedules from the ROTATED token;
 *   - a hidden tab does NOT fire the timer; visibility→visible near/after expiry
 *     refreshes immediately;
 *   - logout + teardown clear timers (no refresh after);
 *   - invalid_grant stops scheduling and opens NO window;
 *   - transient failure retries with bounded backoff;
 *   - a no-refresh-token issuer schedules nothing.
 *
 * MIRRORS-CANDIDATE: this is the upstream-port test surface for the proactive
 * scheduler described in webid-token-provider.ts.
